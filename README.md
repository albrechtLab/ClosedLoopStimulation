# ClosedLoopStimulation

This repository contains files for triggering stimulated neural recordings based on a behavioral or other visual attribute. It was developed to assess changes to neural function between sleep and wake states in the nematode _C. elegans_, as published here: [https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/9/1892](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/41/9/1892)
