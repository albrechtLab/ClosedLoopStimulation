# ClosedLoopStimulation

This repository contains files for triggering stimulated neural recordings based on a behavioral or other visual attribute. It was developed to assess changes to neural function between sleep and wake states in the nematode _C. elegans_, as published here:

Sleep in adult _C. elegans_ occurs spontaneously, making timing of individual sleep/wake state transitions unpredictable. We developed a closed-loop system to automatically detect sleep state transitions and subsequently deliver stimuli and record evoked neural responses. This allows users to assess functional consequences of behavioral states without bias in order to identify state-dependent neuromodulation. 

The closed-loop system is flexible beyonbd sleep detection, and can be configured to detect any visible events (such as specific behavior patterns, locations, or optical reporters) and measure corresponding evoked neural responses.
